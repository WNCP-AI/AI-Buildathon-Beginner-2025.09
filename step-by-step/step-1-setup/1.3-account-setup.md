## Part 1: Lovable Account Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Go to **https://lovable.dev**
2. Click **"Get Started"** or **"Sign Up"**
3. Use your email address (preferably Gmail for easier integration)
4. Create a strong password and save it somewhere safe
5. Verify your email when prompted

### Step 2: Choose Your Plan

**Free Plan Limitations:**
- ‚ùå Limited project builds per month

**For SkyMarket, You'll Need:**
- ‚úÖ **Starter Plan ($20/month)** - Recommended for hackathons

- ‚úÖ Priority support

### Alternative Platforms (If Budget is Tight):

| Platform | Cost | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|------|
| **Dyad** | Free | Good AI assistance | Less features |
| **Google Firebase** | Free tier | Google integration | More technical |
| **Bolt.new** | $20/month | Similar to Lovable | Newer platform |
| **Replit** | $10/month | Good for beginners | Limited AI |

**Note:** If you want to use Cursor IDE, GitHub Copilot, or VS Code, consider the **Developer Track** instead of Beginner Track.

### Step 3: Access Your Dashboard
1. After signing up, you should see the Lovable dashboard
2. You'll see a large text input box in the center where you can describe your project
3. Your plan type should be visible in the top-right corner
4. You're now ready to start building!

**‚úÖ Lovable Setup Complete:** I have a working Lovable account

## Part 2: Supabase Connection (Automatic ‚Äî No Separate Account Needed)

### What is Supabase?
Supabase powers your backend via Lovable's integration:
- **Database**: Stores user profiles, service listings, bookings
- **Authentication**: Manages user signup, login, passwords
- **Storage**: Handles image uploads
- **API**: Connects your frontend to data

### What You Need To Do Now

Nothing yet. In Step 2, you'll connect Supabase from inside Lovable:
1. Open your Lovable project
2. Go to **Integrations** ‚Üí **Supabase**
3. Click **Connect** and follow the prompts

Lovable securely manages all credentials. You will not copy API keys or create a separate Supabase project for the Beginner Track.

### Optional (Advanced Users Only)
If you want full access to the Supabase dashboard later, you may create a personal account at `https://supabase.com` and set up a project. This is not required for completing this track.

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Do you understand that Supabase will be connected automatically in Step 2 inside Lovable?
- Do you know that no API keys are needed right now?

**‚úÖ Supabase Prep Complete:** I'm ready to connect Supabase inside Lovable in Step 2

## Part 3: Resend Account Setup

### What is Resend?
Resend sends emails from your app to users:
- Welcome emails when users sign up
- Booking confirmations
- Notifications to operators
- Password reset emails

### Step 1: Create Resend Account

1. Go to **https://resend.com**
2. Click **"Get Started"**
3. Sign up with the same email as your other accounts
4. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. After login, go to **"API Keys"** in the sidebar
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. **Name:** "SkyMarket Development"
4. **Permission:** "Sending access" (default)
5. Click **"Add"**
6. **Copy the API key** immediately (you can't see it again!)

**Your API key looks like:**
```
re_[random-characters-here]
```

### Step 3: Set Up Domain (Optional for Development)

For development/testing:
- You can send emails using Resend's default domain
- Emails might go to spam, but that's okay for testing

For production (later):
- You'll need to verify your own domain
- This makes emails more professional and reliable

### Step 4: Test Email Sending

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **"Logs"**
2. You should see an empty list (no emails sent yet)
3. We'll test this when building the app

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Can you access your Resend dashboard?
- Have you safely saved your API key?
- Do you understand when your app will send emails?

**‚úÖ Resend Setup Complete:** I have email capabilities configured

## Security Best Practices

### üîí Storing Your Credentials Safely

**‚úÖ Good Practices:**
- Use a password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
- Create a secure note with all your API keys
- Never share keys in screenshots or messages
- Use different passwords for each service

**‚ùå Dangerous Practices:**

### Environment Variables (Advanced Topic)

When you build in Lovable:
- Lovable can store your keys securely
- You won't usually need to manage environment variables manually
- The platform handles security for you

For other platforms:
- Use `.env` files that aren't uploaded to GitHub
- Never put real keys directly in your code
- Use placeholder values in public repositories

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Where are you storing your credentials?
- Have you used unique passwords for each service?
- Do you understand why keeping keys private is important?

**‚úÖ Security Setup Complete:** I'm storing credentials safely
