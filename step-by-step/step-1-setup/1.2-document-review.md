**‚è±Ô∏è Time to Complete:** 15-20 minutes
**üéØ Difficulty:** Beginner (Reading comprehension)
**üìã What You'll Learn:** How to use project documentation to guide your development

---

## Why Documentation Matters

Think of project documentation like **blueprints for building a house**:
- **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**: What rooms you need and how they should work
- **Tech Stack Document**: What materials and tools you'll use
- **Database Schema**: The house's electrical and plumbing layout
- **API Documentation**: How all the systems connect together

### Without Good Documentation:
‚ùå You build features that don't match what users need
‚ùå You waste time figuring out what to build next
‚ùå Your AI prompts are vague and produce poor results
‚ùå Features don't work well together

### With Good Documentation:
‚úÖ You know exactly what to build and why
‚úÖ Your Lovable prompts are specific and effective
‚úÖ Features work together seamlessly
‚úÖ You can explain your project to others

## Practical Examples: Turning Documentation into Lovable Prompts

### Example 1: Building Authentication (Using Knowledge Base)

**From Knowledge Base PRD Section:**
> "Secure Registration: Email-based account creation with validation"
> "Role-Based Access: Differentiated permissions for consumers, operators, and administrators"

**From Knowledge Base Tech Stack Section:**
> "React Hook Form + Zod validation, Supabase Auth, Error boundaries"

**Resulting Lovable Prompt:**
```
Create a user registration page based on our PRD requirements. Include:

1. Email and password fields with validation
2. Role selection (consumer vs. operator)
3. Full name and phone number fields
4. Form validation that shows helpful error messages
5. Integration with Supabase authentication
6. Redirect to appropriate dashboard based on user role

Use modern form patterns with proper error handling as described in our tech stack documentation.
```

### Example 2: Building Service Listings (Using Knowledge Base)

**From Knowledge Base Database Section:**
> "listings table with title, description, category, price, duration_minutes..."

**From Knowledge Base PRD Section:**
> "Service Categories: Photography, delivery, inspection, surveying"
> "Location-Based Discovery: Detroit area focus with geographic filtering"

**Resulting Lovable Prompt:**
```
Create a "Create Service Listing" form for drone operators. Based on our database schema, include:

- Title field (text input, required)
- Description field (textarea, required)
- Category dropdown (aerial_photo, delivery, inspection, surveillance, mapping)
- Price field (number input with dollar formatting)
- Duration field (select dropdown: 30min, 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, custom)
- Service area field (text input, default to "Detroit Metro Area")
- Image upload capability for service photos

Save data to the listings table and show confirmation when successful.
```

### Example 3: Building Email Notifications (Using Knowledge Base)

**From Knowledge Base API Section:**
> "Resend Email Integration" with booking confirmation examples

**Resulting Lovable Prompt:**
```
Set up automated email notifications for booking confirmations. Based on our API documentation:

1. When a customer makes a booking, send confirmation email to customer
2. When a booking is made, send notification email to the operator
3. Use our Resend integration with professional email templates
4. Include booking details: service name, date, time, price, operator info
5. Add SkyMarket branding and styling to emails

Follow the email template patterns shown in our API documentation.
```

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- How do these prompts differ from generic requests?
- What makes referencing documentation helpful for AI?
- Can you think of a feature you'd want to build using this approach?

**‚úÖ Section Complete:** I can create specific Lovable prompts using project documentation

## Component Reusability: Building Once, Using Everywhere

### Why Component Reusability Matters
Instead of recreating similar elements repeatedly, you build them once and reuse them throughout your app.

### Examples from SkyMarket:

**‚ùå Without Reusability:**
- Create login form on login page
- Create separate signup form on signup page
- Create different operator login on operator page
- Create admin login on admin page
‚Üí 4 different forms to maintain and update

**‚úÖ With Reusability:**
- Create one AuthForm component
- Use it on login page, signup page, operator page, admin page
- Customize behavior with props: `<AuthForm type="login" userRole="operator" />`
‚Üí 1 component to maintain, consistent experience

### Lovable Prompts for Reusability:

```
Create a reusable ServiceCard component that can display any drone service. Include:
- Service image with fallback
- Title, description, and price
- Operator name and rating
- "Book Now" or "View Details" button
- Props to customize button text and click behavior

This component should work on the homepage, search results, and operator profiles.
```

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- What elements do you see repeated across different websites?
- How might reusable components save development time?
- What SkyMarket features would benefit from reusable components?

**‚úÖ Section Complete:** I understand how to build reusable components

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Ignoring Documentation
**Bad Prompt:** "Create a login page"
**Why It's Bad:** Too vague, doesn't match project requirements

**‚úÖ Better Prompt:** "Based on our PRD requirements, create a login page with email/password authentication, role selection, and Supabase integration as specified in our tech stack."

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Not Using Specific Field Names
**Bad Prompt:** "Create a form for services"
**Why It's Bad:** AI has to guess what fields you want

**‚úÖ Better Prompt:** "Create a service listing form with these exact fields from our database schema: title, description, category, price, duration_minutes, max_distance_miles, equipment_type"

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Building Without Context
**Bad Prompt:** "Add a dashboard"
**Why It's Bad:** Doesn't specify for which user type or what features

**‚úÖ Better Prompt:** "Create an operator dashboard based on our PRD Phase 1 requirements: stats cards for bookings, recent booking requests, quick actions for service management, and profile completion status"

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Forgetting Integration Requirements
**Bad Prompt:** "Add email notifications"
**Why It's Bad:** Doesn't specify the service or format

**‚úÖ Better Prompt:** "Implement booking confirmation emails using Resend integration as documented in the knowledge base, with the professional template format and SkyMarket branding"

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Which mistakes do you think you might make?
- How do specific prompts help AI understand your needs?
- What documentation would help you avoid these mistakes?

**‚úÖ Section Complete:** I know how to avoid common documentation mistakes
