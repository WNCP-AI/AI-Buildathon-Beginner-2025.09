## Overview: Your Operator Command Center

### What You're Building
You're creating the main dashboard that drone operators see when they log in to manage their business. Think of this as the "mission control" for their services - showing key metrics, recent activity, and quick actions to manage their drone operations.

### Why This Step Matters
- **Business Intelligence:** Operators need to see their key metrics at a glance
- **Quick Actions:** One-click access to common business tasks
- **Professional Feel:** A polished dashboard builds operator confidence
- **Component Reusability:** Dashboard components can be used elsewhere

### What Makes This Special
We're building on the component patterns from Step 3, reusing the SharedHeader and creating new metric cards that follow professional development practices.

### üìù Ask Yourself Before Starting:
- Do I have my operator authentication working from Step 3?
- Can I see the operator dashboard when logged in as an operator?
- Did I complete the landing page and authentication steps?

**‚úÖ Pre-Check Complete:** I'm ready to build the operator dashboard

## Part 1: Understanding the Dashboard Layout

### Dashboard Components We'll Build
Based on the UI mockups and professional marketplace standards, your operator dashboard needs:

1. **Welcome Section** - Personalized greeting and availability toggle
2. **Key Metrics Cards** - Active listings, pending bookings, earnings
3. **Quick Actions** - Create listing, view analytics, manage bookings
4. **Recent Activity Feed** - Latest customer interactions and updates
5. **Performance Overview** - Top services and business insights

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- What information would a busy drone operator need to see first?
- How can we make managing multiple services feel simple?
- What actions should be one-click accessible?

**‚úÖ Layout Understanding:** I know what components we're building

## Part 4: Connecting Real Data

### Add Database Integration

**Copy This Prompt:**
```
Connect the operator dashboard to real Supabase data:

## Database Integration:
1. Fetch operator profile from profiles table using current user ID
2. Count active listings from listings table where operator_id = current user and is_active = true
3. Count pending booking_requests where listing belongs to current operator and status = 'pending'
4. Calculate this week's earnings from completed bookings (if implemented)

## Display Logic:
- Show actual operator name from profile instead of placeholder
- Display real listing count in Active Listings card
- Show actual pending booking number in Pending Bookings card
- Format earnings as currency ($X,XXX.XX)
- Add loading states with skeleton components while data loads
- Handle empty states for new operators with no data yet

## Error Handling:
- Show friendly messages if data fails to load
- Provide fallback values for metrics (show 0 instead of errors)
- Handle authentication properly (redirect to login if not authenticated)

Make the dashboard show live data that updates when the operator's business changes.
```

### What You Should See After Data Integration:
- Real operator name in the welcome message
- Actual count of active listings (may be 0 for new operators)
- Real pending booking count

## Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: "Dashboard shows placeholder data"
**Solution:**
```
Connect the dashboard to real Supabase data. Fetch the operator's profile, count their active listings, and show real booking requests. Replace all placeholder text with actual database queries.
```

### Problem: "Buttons don't work or navigate"
**Solution:**
```
Implement proper navigation for all dashboard buttons. "Create New Listing" should go to the service creation flow, and other buttons should either navigate to their respective pages or show appropriate placeholders.
```

### Problem: "Dashboard looks broken on mobile"
**Solution:**
```
Fix the mobile responsive design. Ensure cards stack properly, tables scroll horizontally, and all touch targets are at least 44px for easy tapping on mobile devices.
```

### Problem: "Loading takes too long or shows errors"
**Solution:**
```
Optimize database queries and add proper error handling. Show loading skeletons while data loads and friendly error messages if something fails. Ensure authentication is working properly.
```

### Problem: "Styling doesn't match the Style Guide"
**Solution:**
```
Apply the exact Style Guide specifications: #BD1B04 for primary buttons, Inter font family, proper shadows (0_2px_8px_rgba(0,0,0,0.04)), and white backgrounds. Ensure consistent styling across all components.
```

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Have I encountered any of these common problems?
- Do I know how to paste a fix into Lovable?
- Is my dashboard working correctly now?

**‚úÖ Troubleshooting Complete:** I know how to fix common dashboard issues
