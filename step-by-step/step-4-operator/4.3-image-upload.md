# 4.3 Image Upload: Professional Photos for Your Services

**‚è±Ô∏è Time to Complete:** 30-40 minutes
**üí∞ Estimated Cost:** Free (using existing Lovable project + Supabase storage)
**üéØ Difficulty:** Beginner (Copy-paste prompts)
**üìã What You'll Learn:** File uploads, cloud storage, image optimization, gallery management

## Overview: Professional Image Management System

### What You're Building
A complete image upload and management system that lets drone operators showcase their services with professional photos. You'll create drag-and-drop uploads, image galleries, and seamless integration with your service management system from Step 4.2.

Think of this like Instagram for your drone services - operators can upload multiple photos, choose a cover image, and create galleries that make their services irresistible to customers.

### Why This Step Matters
**Photos sell services!** Research shows that marketplace listings with professional images get **3x more bookings** than those without. Customers make split-second decisions based on visual appeal. Your image system gives operators the tools to:
- Showcase their best work
- Build customer trust with professional presentation
- Stand out from competitors
- Charge premium prices for quality services

### What Makes This Special
Your image system will integrate perfectly with the service management you built in 4.2. Images automatically connect to services, display in your dashboard metrics, and create a professional marketplace experience that rivals industry leaders like TaskRabbit and Uber.

We're also introducing **cloud storage** - your images will be stored in Supabase Storage, not in your database, which is how professional apps handle media files.

### üìù Ask Yourself Before Starting:
- Did you complete 4.2 Service Management? (You need services to add images to)
- Can you see your service listings in the management table?
- Is your Supabase connection working from previous steps?
- Do you have some sample images ready to test? (Any JPG/PNG files will work)

**‚úÖ Pre-Check Complete:** I'm ready to add professional image capabilities

## Part 1: Understanding Image Upload Architecture

### How Professional Image Systems Work

**Traditional (Wrong) Way:**
- Store images directly in the database ‚ùå
- Makes database huge and slow
- Can't handle large files
- Poor performance

**Professional (Right) Way:**
- Store images in cloud storage (Supabase Storage) ‚úÖ
- Save only the image URL in database
- Fast loading and unlimited storage
- Professional-grade performance

### Image Components We'll Build

1. **Storage Bucket**
   - Cloud storage container for image files
   - Public access for viewing
   - Secure upload with authentication
   - Automatic optimization

2. **Upload Interface**
   - Drag-and-drop zone for easy uploads
   - Multiple file selection
   - Progress bars during upload
   - Image preview before saving

3. **Gallery Management**
   - Grid display of all service images
   - Set primary/cover image
   - Delete unwanted images
   - Reorder by dragging

4. **Service Integration**
   - Add images during service creation
   - Edit images from service management
   - Display images in service cards
   - Show image count badges

### Database Structure
We'll create a `service_images` table:
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `service_id` - Links to your service
- `image_url` - Location in cloud storage
- `is_primary` - Cover image flag
- `display_order` - Gallery ordering
- `created_at` - Upload timestamp

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Do I understand why we use cloud storage instead of the database?
- Can I visualize how images connect to services?
- Am I ready to build Instagram-quality image features?

**‚úÖ Architecture Understanding Complete:** I know how professional image systems work

## Part 2: Setting Up Supabase Storage

First, let's configure Supabase Storage to handle your service images.

### Copy This Entire Prompt Into Lovable:

```
Set up Supabase Storage for service images with proper security and optimization:

## DATABASE SETUP:
Create a new table called 'service_images' with these fields:

Table Structure:
- id: UUID primary key, auto-generate default
- service_id: UUID foreign key referencing listings(id) with CASCADE delete
- image_url: TEXT for the full Supabase storage URL
- image_name: TEXT for original filename
- file_size: INTEGER for size in bytes
- display_order: INTEGER default 0 for gallery ordering
- is_primary: BOOLEAN default false (only one per service)
- uploaded_by: UUID foreign key to auth.users(id)
- created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ default now()
- updated_at: TIMESTAMPTZ default now()

Add these constraints:
- Unique constraint on (service_id, is_primary) where is_primary = true
- Check constraint file_size <= 5242880 (5MB limit)

## RLS POLICIES:
Enable Row Level Security and add these policies:

1. "Operators view own images"
   - SELECT: auth.uid() = uploaded_by

2. "Operators upload images"
   - INSERT: auth.uid() = uploaded_by

3. "Operators update own images"
   - UPDATE: auth.uid() = uploaded_by

4. "Operators delete own images"
   - DELETE: auth.uid() = uploaded_by

5. "Public view primary images"
   - SELECT: is_primary = true (for marketplace display)

## STORAGE BUCKET:
Create a public storage bucket called 'service-images' with:
- Public read access for displaying images
- Authenticated upload (operators must be logged in)
- File size limit: 5MB per image
- Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp
- File name pattern: {user_id}/{service_id}/{timestamp}_{filename}

## STORAGE POLICIES:
Add these storage policies to the bucket:

1. "Authenticated users can upload"
   - Action: INSERT
   - Check: auth.role() = 'authenticated'

2. "Public can view images"
   - Action: SELECT
   - Check: true (public access)

3. "Owners can delete"
   - Action: DELETE
   - Check: auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]

## HELPER FUNCTIONS:
Create a database function to manage primary images:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION set_primary_image(
  p_service_id UUID,
  p_image_id UUID
) RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Remove existing primary
  UPDATE service_images
  SET is_primary = false
  WHERE service_id = p_service_id;

  -- Set new primary
  UPDATE service_images
  SET is_primary = true
  WHERE id = p_image_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

Show a success message when setup is complete: "Image storage system configured successfully!"
```

### What You Should See:
- Success message confirming setup
- New `service_images` table in your database
- `service-images` bucket in Supabase Storage
- Proper security policies in place

### If Something Goes Wrong:
**Problem:** "Storage bucket creation failed"
**Fix:** Try this simpler approach:
```
Just create the basic storage setup:
1. Create a public bucket called 'service-images'
2. Allow public read access
3. Require authentication for uploads
4. Set 5MB file size limit
We'll handle the database table separately if needed.
```

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Did the success message appear?
- Can I see the new table in Supabase?
- Is the storage bucket created?

**‚úÖ Storage Setup Complete:** Cloud storage is ready for images
