## Overview: The Heart of Your Marketplace

### What You're Building
You're creating the main marketplace page where customers browse and search for drone services, courier deliveries, and other services in the Detroit area. This is like the homepage of DoorDash or Uber - where the discovery happens!

### Why This Step Matters
- **Customer Experience:** This is where users spend most of their time finding services
- **Discovery Engine:** Good search and filtering means happy customers who find what they need
- **Professional Feel:** A polished marketplace builds trust and credibility
- **Component Foundation:** The ServiceCard components you build here will be reused throughout the app

### What Makes This Special
We're implementing **advanced features** that usually require experienced developers:
- Smart search that finds services even with typos
- Real-time filtering as you type
- Professional loading states
- Shareable search URLs

### üìù Ask Yourself Before Starting:
- Do I have my Lovable project open from previous steps?
- Have I completed Step 3.1 with the SharedHeader component?
- Am I ready to build something that feels like a real marketplace?

**‚úÖ Pre-Check Complete:** I understand what I'm building and why it matters

## Part 1: Referencing Your Components

### Building on Previous Work
Remember the SharedHeader component from Step 3.1? We'll reuse it here! This is professional development - build once, use many times.

### Components We'll Create
1. **ServiceCard:** Displays individual services (reusable everywhere!)
2. **CategoryFilter:** The pill-shaped category buttons
3. **SearchBar:** Smart search that waits for you to finish typing
4. **EmptyState:** What shows when no results are found

### Documents to Reference
- **STYLE-GUIDE.md:** Our exact colors (#BD1B04 accent, #9D1503 hover)
- **UI-202-Browse-Services.md:** The marketplace layout specification
- **Step 3.1:** To import the SharedHeader component

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Do I remember creating the SharedHeader in Step 3.1?
- Can I visualize what a service card should look like?
- Do I understand that we're building reusable LEGO blocks?

**‚úÖ Component Check:** I'm ready to build on my previous work

## Part 2: The Complete Marketplace Prompt

### Copy This Entire Prompt Into Lovable:

```
Create a comprehensive marketplace browsing page for SkyMarket that feels professional like DoorDash or Uber.

REUSE the SharedHeader component from Step 3.1 - import it, don't recreate it.

Create a browse services page with these exact specifications:

VISUAL DESIGN:
- Use white background throughout
- Primary text should be black with 87% opacity for headlines and prices
- Secondary text should be gray (#4A4A4A) with 56% opacity for descriptions
- Primary accent color #BD1B04 for buttons and active states
- Hover state color #9D1503 for interactive elements
- Use Inter font family with appropriate weights
- Minimum touch targets of 44px for mobile
- Cards should have rounded corners (8px radius)

PAGE LAYOUT:
Create a page at /browse-services containing:
- The imported SharedHeader at the top
- A page title "Browse Services" in large bold text
- A service count like "47 services found" in smaller gray text
- A search bar with magnifying glass icon
- Category filter pills in a horizontal row
- A responsive grid of service cards
- A "Load More" button at the bottom

SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY:
Build a search bar that:
- Has a magnifying glass icon on the left side
- Shows placeholder text "Search services, operators, or locations..."
- Waits 300ms after the user stops typing before searching
- Searches through service names, descriptions, and operator names
- Finds partial matches and handles typos gracefully
- Shows a clear button (√ó) when text is entered
- Updates results in real-time as you type
- Updates the page URL with the search term

CATEGORY FILTERS:
Create pill-shaped filter buttons for:
- "All Services" - shows everything
- "Food üçï" - food delivery services
- "Courier üì¶" - package delivery
- "Aerial üì∑" - photography services
- "Mapping üó∫Ô∏è" - surveying and mapping

Make the pills:
- Show active state with #BD1B04 background and white text
- Show inactive state with white background and gray border
- Change to #9D1503 on hover when active
- Allow multiple selections using OR logic
- Scroll horizontally on mobile if needed

SERVICE CARDS:
Create reusable service cards that display:
- A circular operator photo (60x60 pixels, use placeholder)
- Operator name in semibold 18pt text
- Star rating like "‚≠ê 4.8 (127 reviews)" in accent color
- Service category badge with icon
- Service description (max 2 lines)
- Price in bold 16pt text
- Estimated time like "30-45 min" with clock icon
- Service area like "Downtown, Midtown"
- "Book Now" button with #BD1B04 background

Card styling:
- White background with subtle shadow
- Stronger shadow on hover with smooth transition
- Proper padding and spacing between elements
- Responsive sizing that works on all devices

RESPONSIVE GRID:
- Show 3 cards per row on desktop
- Show 2 cards per row on tablet
- Show 1 card per row on mobile
- Use consistent gaps between cards
- Center the grid with max width of 1280px

SAMPLE SERVICES:
Include at least 6 example services like:
1. "Detroit Drones LLC" - Food delivery, $29.99, 15-30 min, Downtown/Midtown
2. "Motor City Sky" - Package delivery, $19.99, 30-45 min, All Metro Areas
3. "SkyView Detroit" - Aerial photography, $199/hr, 2-4 hours, Greater Detroit
4. "Urban Mapping Co" - Site mapping, $299, 24-48 hours, Wayne County
5. "Quick Parcels" - Express courier, $34.99, 45-90 min, Downtown Only
6. "Coney Express" - Food delivery, $15.99, 20-35 min, Eastern Market

LOADING & EMPTY STATES:
- Show skeleton cards with pulsing animation while loading
- Display "No services found" with suggestions when filters return no results
- Include a "Clear all filters" button in the empty state

Make everything work smoothly with professional animations and transitions. The marketplace should feel as polished as commercial apps like DoorDash or Uber.

## Part 5: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Search Isn't Working
**Symptom:** Typing doesn't filter results
**Fix:** Copy this recovery prompt:
```
The search needs to work properly. Make it:
1. Search through service names, descriptions, and operator names
2. Wait 300ms after typing stops before searching
3. Find partial matches and handle typos
4. Show a clear button when there's text
5. Update results immediately after the delay
```

### Problem: Layout Breaks on Mobile
**Symptom:** Cards don't stack properly or overflow
**Fix:** Copy this responsive fix:
```
Fix the responsive grid layout:
1. Make cards stack in a single column on mobile screens
2. Show 2 columns on tablets
3. Show 3 columns on desktop
4. Add proper spacing between cards
5. Ensure cards don't overflow on small screens
```

### Problem: Colors Don't Match Style Guide
**Symptom:** Red isn't the right shade, text looks wrong
**Fix:** Copy this color correction:
```
Update all colors to match exactly:
- Primary accent: #BD1B04 for buttons and active states
- Hover accent: #9D1503 for hover effects
- Primary text: black with 87% opacity
- Secondary text: #4A4A4A with 56% opacity

### Problem: Category Pills Don't Work

2. When clicked, toggle between active and inactive states
3. Filter services to show only selected categories
4. If no categories selected, show all services
5. Active pills should have #BD1B04 background
6. Allow multiple categories to be selected at once
```
