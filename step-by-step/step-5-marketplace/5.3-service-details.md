## Part 1: Page Setup & Navigation (10 minutes)

### What You're Building
Set up the routing for individual service pages and add navigation elements like breadcrumbs and a back button.

### Copy This Navigation Prompt:

```
Create a service detail page with dynamic routing and navigation. This page shows when users click on a service from the browse page.

PAGE SETUP:
Create a new page with dynamic routing that:
- Uses the pattern /service/[id] to display individual services
- Receives a service ID from the URL parameter
- Loads the appropriate service data based on that ID
- Shows a "Service Not Found" message if the ID doesn't exist

NAVIGATION STRUCTURE:
Add these navigation elements at the top:

1. Import and reuse the SharedHeader component from Step 3.1 (don't recreate it)

2. Create breadcrumb navigation that shows:
- "Home" link (goes to homepage)
- Forward slash separator
- "Browse Services" link (goes to /browse-services)
- Forward slash separator
- Current service name (not clickable, shows where user is)
- Style: Small text, gray for links, hover effect changes to accent color #BD1B04
- Spacing: Horizontal layout with small gaps between items

3. Add a back button that:
- Shows arrow icon pointing left
- Says "Back to Services"
- Uses accent color #BD1B04 that changes to #9D1503 on hover
- When clicked, navigates back to previous page in browser history
- Has proper spacing below header and above content

CONTAINER LAYOUT:
- Maximum width of 1280px centered on page
- Horizontal padding: 20px on mobile, 32px on desktop
- Vertical padding: 32px top and bottom
- White background throughout

ROUTING LOGIC:
- Extract service ID from the URL parameters
- Find matching service from your data
- If service exists: Display the service details
- If service doesn't exist: Show friendly "Service Not Found" message with:
  - Large heading saying "Service Not Found"
  - Explanation text "This service is no longer available"
  - Link to browse other services in accent color

The navigation should help users understand where they are and easily go back to browsing.
```

### What You Should See
- SharedHeader at the top (from Step 3.1)
- Breadcrumb trail: Home / Browse Services / [Service Name]
- Back button with arrow icon
- Proper spacing and container width

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Can I navigate to a service detail page from browse?
- Do the breadcrumbs show the correct path?
- Does the back button work properly?

**‚úÖ Navigation Complete:** Users can find their way!
