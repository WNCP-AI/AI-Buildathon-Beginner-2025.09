## Part 1: Starting Your Lovable Project

### Step 1: Access Your Dashboard

1. **Go to Your Lovable Dashboard**
   - Open **https://lovable.dev** in your browser
   - Click **"Sign In"** (top right corner)
   - Enter your email and password from Step 1.3

   üí° **Tip:** Bookmark lovable.dev now. You'll use it constantly!

### Step 2: Create Your SkyMarket Project

1. **Start New Project**
   - You'll see a large text input box in the center of the dashboard
   - This box will have placeholder text like "What would you like to build?" or "Describe your app idea"
   - Click inside this text box to start typing

2. **Use This Exact Starting Prompt**
   Copy and paste this prompt exactly into the large text box:
Create a SkyMarket Drone Marketplace app. This is a marketplace where people can book drone delivery services in Detroit. Start with a simple homepage that says "Welcome to SkyMarket" and has a button that says "Find Drone Services". Use a modern, clean design with a blue and white color scheme.
```

3. **Create the Project**
   - Click **"Create Project"** or **"Start Building"**
   - Wait 10-30 seconds while Lovable sets things up
   - Don't close the browser tab during this time!

### What You Should See:
- Loading screen with progress indicator
- "Setting up your project..." message
- Eventually, your project interface loads with three main sections

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Did the project creation start without errors?
- Can I see a loading or progress indicator?

**‚úÖ Project Creation Complete:** I can see the Lovable project interface

## Part 2: Critical Setup - Project Security

### Step 1: Set Your Project Password
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL STEP - DO NOT SKIP THIS!**

When your project loads, you need to secure it:

1. **Find Project Settings**
   - Look for the **gear icon** (‚öôÔ∏è) usually in the top right
   - Or look for **"Project Settings"** in a menu
   - Click to open settings

2. **Set Password Protection**
   - Find **"Password Protection"** or **"Access Control"**
   - Click **"Set Password"** or **"Enable Password"**
   - Create a strong password you'll remember

3. **Save Your Password in Multiple Places**
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Write it down RIGHT NOW:

   **Project Password:** ___________________

   Also save in:
   - [ ] Your phone notes app
   - [ ] A secure password manager
   - [ ] Write it on paper and keep it safe

‚ö†Ô∏è **Why This Matters:** You need this password to share your project with mentors, submit for judging, or access it from different devices.

### Step 2: Name Your Project Properly

1. **Find Project Name Setting**
   - Still in Project Settings
   - Look for **"Project Name"** field

2. **Use This Naming Format:**
   - Format: **"SkyMarket-YourName"**
   - Examples: "SkyMarket-Sarah", "SkyMarket-Team1", "SkyMarket-Alex"
   - Keep it short but memorable

3. **Save Settings**
   - Click **"Save"** or **"Apply"**
   - Close the settings panel

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Did I save my password in at least 2 places?
- Is my project named "SkyMarket-[MyName]"?
- Can I see the settings have been saved?

**‚úÖ Security Complete:** My project is password-protected and properly named

## Part 3: Understanding Your Workspace

### The Three Main Areas:

1. **Left Side: Chat/Prompt Area**
   - This is where you type instructions to Lovable
   - Think of it as talking to a smart developer
   - Your prompts go here

2. **Middle: Code Editor**
   - Shows the code Lovable generates
   - You don't need to understand this yet
   - Focus on the chat and preview for now

3. **Right Side: Live Preview**
   - Shows your app as users will see it
   - Updates automatically when you make changes
   - This is where you'll see your marketplace come to life

### Don't Worry About:
- Understanding the code (middle section)
- File structures or folders (for now)
- Error messages in the code editor (unless they stop the preview)

### Focus On:
- The chat area (where you type)
- The preview (what your app looks like)
- Whether changes appear when you make them

---

## Part 4: First Test - Make Sure Everything Works

### Test Your Setup

1. **Make Your First Change**
   In the chat area, type this exact prompt:

```
Change the button text from "Find Drone Services" to "Browse Available Drones" and make the button green instead of blue
```

2. **Watch for Results**
   - Press Enter and wait 5-15 seconds
   - Watch the preview on the right side
   - The button should change color and text

### What Should Happen:
- ‚úÖ Preview updates within 15 seconds
- ‚úÖ Button becomes green
- ‚úÖ Text changes to "Browse Available Drones"
- ‚úÖ Rest of the page stays the same

### If Something Goes Wrong:
Try this simpler prompt:
```
Make the main button on the page green
```

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Did the preview update when I sent the prompt?
- Can I see the green button?
- Do I understand where to type prompts (left side)?

**‚úÖ First Test Complete:** I can make changes and see them in the preview

---

## Part 5: Project Configuration

### Step 1: Enable Auto-Save

1. **Go Back to Project Settings** (gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è)
2. **Find Auto-Save Setting**
   - Look for **"Auto-save"** or **"Automatic Saving"**
   - Toggle it to **ON** or **Enabled**
3. **Enable Live Preview**
   - Find **"Live Preview"** or **"Real-time Updates"**
   - Make sure it's **ON**

### Step 2: Set Preview Preferences

1. **Preview Size**
   - Look for preview size options (Desktop/Tablet/Mobile)
   - Start with **Desktop** view
   - You can test other sizes later

2. **Browser Refresh**
   - If preview looks broken, look for a **refresh** button above the preview
   - Click it to reload the preview

### Why These Settings Matter:
- **Auto-save:** Your changes save automatically (no Ctrl+S needed)
- **Live Preview:** You see changes immediately
- **Preview Settings:** Test how your app looks on different devices

‚ö†Ô∏è **Save these in a secure place:**

| What You Need | Your Information | Where to Find It |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Project URL** | _________________ | Browser address bar |
| **Project Password** | _________________ | The one you just created |
| **Project Name** | SkyMarket-________ | Project Settings |
