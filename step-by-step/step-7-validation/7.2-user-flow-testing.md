## What You're Learning
- Time: 45-60 minutes
- Difficulty: Intermediate
- Cost: Free

### Learning Objectives
- Test complete user journeys from start to finish

- Validate that real user goals can be accomplished

## Why User Flow Testing Matters

Think of user flow testing like following a recipe from start to finish – not just checking individual ingredients, but making sure the whole cooking process works smoothly.

In Step 7.1, you tested individual features (like checking if each ingredient was fresh). Now you're testing complete user journeys (like making sure you can actually cook the entire meal without problems).

### Ask Yourself
- Can a new operator actually complete their first listing from signup to going live?
- Can a customer actually book and complete a service without getting stuck?
- What happens if someone gets interrupted halfway through?
- Does the experience feel smooth and professional?

```
Test cross-device consistency:

1. Start browsing services on your phone
2. Save a service to favorites or start booking process
3. Switch to desktop computer
4. Log into same account

6. Complete the booking on desktop

The experience should feel seamless across devices.
```

## Interruption Recovery Testing

### What Happens When Users Get Distracted?
**Real Life Scenario:** User starts booking process but gets interrupted and comes back later.

**Copy This Test Script:**
```
Test interruption recovery:

1. Start booking a service as a customer
2. Fill out half the booking form
3. Close browser completely
4. Wait 10 minutes
5. Return to your app
6. Try to complete the booking

Also test:
- What if payment fails partway through?
- What if user's session expires during booking?
- What if user starts on mobile but needs to finish on desktop?
```

**What You Should See:**
- App remembers progress where possible
- Clear way to restart if needed
- No lost information that would frustrate users
- Helpful error messages if something goes wrong

## User Experience Quality Checks

### The "Mom Test"
**Imagine your mom (or non-tech-savvy friend) using your app:**

**Copy This Evaluation:**
```
Have someone unfamiliar with your app try these tasks:

1. "Find a drone service for real estate photography in your area"
2. "Book that service for next Tuesday afternoon"
3. "Check if you can change the appointment time"
4. "Find where to contact the operator"

Observe without helping. Note every moment they:
- Look confused
- Click the wrong thing
- Can't find what they need
- Express frustration

These are your friction points to fix.
```

### Professional Feel Check
**Does your app feel trustworthy for $100+ transactions?**

**Questions to Ask:**
- Do service listings look professional and complete?
- Does the booking process feel secure?
- Are operator profiles thorough and credible?
- Does communication feel business-appropriate?
- Would you trust this app with your own money?
