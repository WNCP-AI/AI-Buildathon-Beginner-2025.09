## Overview: Your Testing Toolkit

Think of verification prompts as your quality control checklist. Instead of randomly clicking around your app hoping it works, you'll use specific prompts that test each feature systematically.

**Why This Matters:**
- Catch bugs before they frustrate users
- Build confidence your app actually works
- Develop professional testing habits
- Learn to think like your users

## Ask Yourself First
- Can I describe what each major feature should do?
- Do I know the difference between "it looks right" and "it works right"?
- Am I ready to test edge cases and error conditions?
- Do I want to ship a polished app or just hope for the best?

## Authentication System Verification

- Do all features work with real data, not just test data?
- Would you be confident showing this app to others?

## What's Next

With systematic verification prompts, you've developed professional quality assurance skills. You can now:
- Test features systematically rather than randomly
- Catch bugs before users encounter them
- Verify both happy paths and error conditions
- Build confidence in your app's reliability

**Pro Tip:** Make verification a habit, not a one-time activity. Test early, test often, and your users will thank you with their continued engagement.

Remember: A bug found in testing is a bug that won't embarrass you in front of users. These verification prompts are your quality control safety net.
