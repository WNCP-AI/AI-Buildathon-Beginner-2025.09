# 7.1 Individual Feature Testing

## What You're Learning
**Time:** 45 minutes
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Beginner+
**Cost:** Free

**You'll master:**
- Testing individual features systematically
- Verifying database connections work correctly
- Checking user role functionality
- Validating data persistence
- Identifying broken features before user testing

## Why Test Features Individually?

Think of your SkyMarket app like a car. Before taking it on a road trip (user flows), you need to check that each part works: brakes, lights, engine, etc.

Individual feature testing means testing one thing at a time - like checking if "Create Listing" works by itself, separate from the full booking process.

**Benefits:**
- Find problems faster (know exactly which feature broke)
- Fix issues before they affect multiple areas
- Build confidence that your foundation is solid
- Save debugging time later

## Ask Yourself First

Before starting these tests, reflect:
- Can you see all the main pages of your app?
- Do you remember what each feature is supposed to do?
- Are you testing in a systematic way or randomly clicking?
- When something doesn't work, do you note exactly what went wrong?

üí° **Pro tip:** Keep a notepad open to track issues as you find them.

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: "Not authenticated" errors
**What's happening:** Database security rules blocking access
**Quick fix:**
```
Check that you're logged in and try this recovery prompt:
"Please verify all authentication is working and users can access their own data according to row-level security policies"
```

### Issue: Images not uploading
**What's happening:** Supabase storage not configured properly
**Quick fix:**
```
"Please check Supabase storage bucket configuration and ensure image uploads work with proper file size limits"
```

### Issue: Search returns no results
**What's happening:** Search function not connected to database
**Quick fix:**
```
"Please verify the search functionality queries the listings table correctly and returns matching results"
```

### Issue: Bookings not appearing for operators
**What's happening:** Database relationship not working
**Quick fix:**
```
"Please check that booking requests properly link to listings through operator_id relationships"
```

## Final Feature Testing Checklist

Before moving to Step 7.2 (User Flow Testing), verify:

- [ ] Operator signup works
- [ ] Login works for both roles
- [ ] Role-based dashboards display

**Data Management:**
- [ ] Listings can be created, edited, deleted
- [ ] Images upload successfully
- [ ] Search finds relevant listings
- [ ] Data persists after refresh

**Booking System:**
- [ ] Consumers can create booking requests
- [ ] Operators can see pending bookings
- [ ] Status updates work both directions
- [ ] Booking history saves correctly

**Security:**
- [ ] Users only see appropriate data
- [ ] Can't edit other users' content
- [ ] Authentication required for protected actions

## What's Next?

Great job testing individual features! Now that you know each piece works, Step 7.2 will test complete user journeys (like "consumer finds and books a service end-to-end").

**Key difference:**
- **Step 7.1 (this step):** "Does the login button work?"
- **Step 7.2 (next step):** "Can someone complete the entire booking process from start to finish?"

If any features failed testing, fix them before moving on. A broken individual feature will definitely break user flows!

**Pro tip:** Keep this checklist handy - you can rerun these tests anytime you make changes to ensure nothing breaks.
