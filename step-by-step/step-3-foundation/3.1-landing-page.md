**üéØ Difficulty:** Beginner (Copy-paste prompts)
**üìã What You'll Learn:** Creating reusable components, implementing visual design, building responsive layouts

---

## Overview: Your First Real Feature!

### What You're Building
You're creating the homepage that visitors see when they first arrive at SkyMarket. This page needs to immediately communicate what SkyMarket does, build trust, and guide visitors to sign up or browse services.

### Why This Step Matters
- **Foundation for Everything:** The components you build here (especially SharedHeader) will be reused throughout the entire app
- **Visual Identity:** This establishes the look and feel that users will associate with SkyMarket
- **Conversion Point:** A good landing page turns visitors into users

### What Makes This Special
We're introducing **component reusability** - like building with LEGO blocks that you can use over and over again. The header you create here will appear on every page of your app!

### üìù Ask Yourself Before Starting:
- Do I have my Lovable project open from Step 2?
- Can I see the preview panel on the right side?
- Did I upload my project documents (PRD, Style Guide, UI screens) in Step 2.3?

**‚úÖ Pre-Check Complete:** I'm ready to build my first feature


---

## Part 2: Referencing Your Documents

### Using Your Knowledge Base
Remember in Step 2.3 when you uploaded your project documents? Now we'll use them!

### How to Reference Documents in Prompts:
- **Direct Reference:** "Based on the Style Guide in my knowledge base..."
- **Specific Details:** "Using the colors from STYLE-GUIDE.md..."
- **UI References:** "Following the layout in UI-001-Landing-Page..."

### Documents You'll Reference:
1. **STYLE-GUIDE.md:** Colors (#BD1B04), fonts (Inter), spacing (8pt grid)
2. **UI-001-Landing-Page.md:** Layout structure and components
3. **Knowledge Base:** Feature descriptions and user value propositions from PRD section

### Pro Tip:
Start your prompts with "Based on the Style Guide and UI screens in my knowledge base..." to ensure Lovable uses your uploaded documents.

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Can I remember what documents I uploaded in Step 2.3?
- Do I know the primary accent color from the Style Guide? (It's #BD1B04!)

**‚úÖ Reference Check:** I know how to reference my uploaded documents

## Part 5: Making Adjustments

### Common Adjustments You Might Want:

**If the hero section feels cramped:**
```
Add more spacing to the hero section. Increase the padding to py-24 or py-32 to give it more breathing room.
```

**If you want card animations:**
```
Add a subtle scale animation to the service cards on hover. When someone hovers, the card should slightly grow (scale-105) with a smooth transition.
```

**If the mobile menu doesn't work:**
```
Make the mobile hamburger menu functional. Add a state to track if it's open, and show/hide the navigation links when clicked.
```

**If you want to change the headline:**
```
Change the main headline to "Your Trusted Drone Delivery Partner in Detroit" and make it slightly larger on desktop.
```

**If the search doesn't look right:**
```
Improve the search bar styling. Add a white background, border, and more padding to the input field. Make the search button taller to match the input height.
```

### How to Apply Adjustments:
1. Copy one of the adjustment prompts above
2. Paste it into Lovable's chat
3. Press Enter and wait for updates
4. Check the preview to see changes

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Is there anything about the design I'd like to adjust?
- Do all the interactive elements (buttons, links) show hover effects?
- Is the spacing comfortable and not too cramped?

**‚úÖ Adjustments Complete:** I've customized the page to my liking

## Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: "Inter font doesn't look right"
**Solution:**
```
Add the Inter font from Google Fonts. Include this in the HTML head:
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
Then ensure all text uses font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
```

### Problem: "Colors don't match the Style Guide"
**Solution:**
```
Fix all the colors to match the Style Guide exactly:
- Primary red: #BD1B04 (not any other shade of red)
- Hover red: #9D1503
- White: #FFFFFF
- Gray text: #6B7280
Update all buttons, links, and accents to use these exact colors.
```

### Problem: "Mobile menu doesn't open"
**Solution:**
```
Make the mobile menu functional:
1. Add a state variable for menu open/closed
2. Toggle this state when hamburger is clicked
3. Show/hide navigation links based on state
4. Add smooth transition animation
```

### Problem: "Cards aren't in a grid"
**Solution:**
```
Fix the service cards grid layout. Use these exact Tailwind classes:
- Container: grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6
- Make sure each ServiceCard is a child of this grid container
```

### Problem: "Search bar looks wrong"
**Solution:**
```
Improve the search bar appearance:
- White background with border
- Proper height (at least 48px)
- Rounded corners on input and button
- Button same height as input
- Magnifying glass icon in button
```

### Emergency Recovery:
If something goes really wrong:
```
Start over with a clean landing page. Create a simple homepage with:
1. A header with "SkyMarket" logo and navigation
2. A hero section with headline and search bar
3. Four service category cards
4. A footer with links
Use the Style Guide colors: white background and #BD1B04 for buttons.
```

### üìù Ask Yourself:
- Have I encountered any of these problems?
- Do I know how to paste a fix into Lovable?
- Is my page working correctly now?

**‚úÖ Troubleshooting Complete:** I know how to fix common issues
