## üìã Introduction & Project Overview

### Understanding Two-Sided Marketplaces

Think of it like a farmers' market. Sellers set up stalls. Buyers browse and purchase. You own the space and take a small fee.

In SkyMarket:
- **Drone operators** = Sellers (offer services)
- **Consumers** = Buyers (book services)
- **You** = Platform owner (connect them)

### Key Terms
- **Marketplace:** Platform connecting buyers and sellers
- **Operator:** Person offering drone services
- **Consumer:** Person booking drone services
- **Listing:** Service offered by an operator

### Your 8 Phases

1. **Setup** (30 min) - Accounts and project creation
2. **Supabase** (20 min) - Database connection
3. **Foundation** (1.5 hours) - Landing page and auth
4. **Operator** (2 hours) - Dashboard and listings
5. **Marketplace** (2 hours) - Browse and search
6. **Consumer** (1.5 hours) - Booking and accounts
7. **Validation** (1 hour) - Testing everything
8. **Extensions** (Optional) - Extra features

### ‚úÖ Check Before Moving On
- Understand marketplace concept?
- Know the 8 phases?
- Ready to build without coding?

## üìê Spec-Driven Development

### Working with Requirements

Think of specs like a recipe. PRD tells you what to cook. Tech stack tells you the ingredients. You follow both for success.

### Component Reusability Magic

**Always start prompts with:**
```
Create a reusable component that...
```

This builds blocks you use everywhere. Like LEGO pieces.

### Example Reusable Component

Copy This Prompt:
```
Create a reusable ServiceCard component for a drone marketplace with these exact specifications:

Structure & Layout:
- Container: bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300 w-80 mx-auto sm:w-full
- Image section: h-48 bg-gray-200 rounded-t-xl relative overflow-hidden with placeholder text "Service Photo"
- Content padding: p-6 space-y-4

Content Elements:
- Service title: text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 line-clamp-2
- Operator name: text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2 format "by [operatorName]"
- Description: text-gray-700 text-sm line-clamp-3 mb-4
- Price: text-2xl font-bold text-red-600 (#BD1B04) text-right format "$XX/hour"
- CTA button: w-full bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white font-semibold py-3 rounded-lg transition-colors

Props Interface:
- title: string
- operatorName: string
- description: string
- pricePerHour: number
- imageUrl?: string
- onBookClick: () => void

Responsive Design:
- Mobile: w-full max-w-sm
- Desktop: w-80 hover:scale-105 transition-transform

Accessibility:
- Image alt text from service title
- Button ARIA label "Book [service title]"
- Proper heading hierarchy with h3 for title
```

### What You Should See
After running this prompt, you should see:
- A clean white card with rounded corners and subtle shadow
- Placeholder image area at the top (gray background with "Service Photo" text)
- Service title in large, bold dark text
- Brief description text in smaller gray font (truncated if too long)
- Price displayed prominently in red on the right side (e.g., "$75/hour")
- Operator name in small text (e.g., "by John's Drone Services")
- Red "Book Now" button spanning the full width at the bottom
- Card should be 320px wide on desktop and look professional

### Following Design Patterns

**Good Pattern:**
- One component, many uses
- Consistent styling
- Easy to update

**Bad Pattern:**
- Duplicate code everywhere
- Different styles each page
- Hard to maintain
