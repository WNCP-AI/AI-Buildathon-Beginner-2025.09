# Fixing Common Lovable Problems

## Errors Are Normal! üåü

Building apps means hitting bumps. That's totally normal! Even experts fix things constantly.

Think of it like cooking. Sometimes you add too much salt. You fix it and move on.

In Lovable, most problems have simple fixes. This guide shows you exactly what to copy and paste.

## Quick Diagnosis

### Before Anything Else, Check These:
- Is your preview showing? If no ‚Üí See Problem A
- Did Lovable stop responding? If yes ‚Üí See Problem B
- Is something not clickable? If yes ‚Üí See Problem C
- Did your design disappear? If yes ‚Üí See Problem D
- Getting error messages? If yes ‚Üí See Problem E

### The Golden Rule
**When stuck, always try this first:**
1. Click the preview refresh button (circular arrow)
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. If still broken, use a recovery prompt below

## Problem A: Preview Not Loading

**What's happening:** The right side stays blank or shows loading forever.

**Quick fix:**
```
Please regenerate the current preview. Make sure all components are properly connected and the app can load.
```

**If that doesn't work:**
1. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try this stronger prompt:

```
The preview is not loading. Please:
1. Check for any syntax errors
2. Ensure all imports are correct
3. Regenerate the main App component
4. Show me the app running with the homepage visible
```

## Problem B: Lovable Stopped Responding

**What's happening:** You type prompts but nothing happens.

**Quick fix:**
1. Look for the "Regenerate" button
2. Click it to retry your last prompt
3. If no button, type a simple test prompt:

```
Show me the current state of the app
```

**If that doesn't work:**
- Save your work (copy important prompts to notepad)
- Refresh the entire Lovable page
- Start with this recovery prompt:

```
Please restore the app to its last working state. Show me the homepage with all navigation working.
```

## Problem C: Buttons or Links Not Working

**What's happening:** You click things but nothing happens.

**Quick fix:**
```
The [button/link name] is not working when clicked. Please:
1. Add the proper onClick handler
2. Connect it to the right page/action
3. Test that clicking works in the preview
```

**Common specific fixes:**

For navigation issues:
```
The navigation menu items are not clickable. Please make sure each menu item properly navigates to its page when clicked.
```

For forms:
```
The submit button doesn't do anything. Please add proper form submission that shows a success message.
```

## Problem D: Design Disappeared or Looks Broken

**What's happening:** Your nice design suddenly looks wrong.

**Quick fix:**
```
The design/styling broke. Please restore the previous good-looking version with [describe what you want: "purple header", "centered layout", "card grid", etc.]
```

**For specific issues:**

Lost colors:
```
Please restore the color scheme. Use purple (#8B5CF6) for primary elements and keep the clean white background.
```

Broken layout:
```
The layout is broken. Please fix:
1. Center all content properly
2. Add proper spacing between elements
3. Make sure it looks good on mobile too
```

## Problem E: Error Messages

**What's happening:** Red text or error boxes appear.

### Common Lovable Errors and Fixes:

**"Component not found"**
```
Fix the component import error. Make sure all components are properly created and imported where needed.
```

**"Unexpected token" or "Syntax error"**
```
There's a syntax error in the code. Please find and fix it, then show me the working app.
```

**"Failed to compile"**
```
The app won't compile. Please:
1. Fix any code errors
2. Make sure all files are valid
3. Show me the app running properly
```

## The "Ask" Feature Power Tool üîç

When nothing else works, use Lovable's secret weapon: the Ask feature.

### How to Use Ask for Debugging:

1. **Start with Ask:**
```
Ask: Why is [describe the problem]? Research what might be causing this issue.
```

2. **Wait for Lovable to investigate** (it will analyze the code)

3. **Then implement the fix:**
```
Based on your research, please implement a plan to fix the issue completely.
```

### Example Ask Workflow:

**Step 1 - Research:**
```
Ask: Why is the booking form not saving data? Check all form connections and data handling.
```

**Step 2 - Fix:**
```
Now implement a complete fix for the booking form based on what you found.
```

## Universal Recovery Prompts

### The "Start Over" Prompt
When things are really broken:
```
The app has multiple issues. Please create a fresh, working version with:
1. Homepage with navigation
2. Service listings page
3. Operator dashboard
4. All pages connected and clickable
Keep the purple theme and professional look.
```

### The "Rollback" Prompt
When your last change broke things:
```
The last change broke the app. Please revert to the previous working version before that change.
```

### The "Show Me" Prompt
When you're not sure what's there:
```
Please show me:
1. What pages currently exist
2. Which features are working
3. What still needs to be built
Display the main page in the preview.
```

## When to Refresh vs Regenerate vs Rollback

### Refresh (üîÑ button)
**Use when:** Preview looks frozen or outdated
**How:** Click the circular arrow in preview
**Wait:** 3-5 seconds

### Regenerate
**Use when:** Last prompt didn't work right
**How:** Click "Regenerate" button under the response
**Wait:** 10-20 seconds

### Rollback
**Use when:** Recent changes made things worse
**How:** Use the rollback prompt above
**Wait:** 20-30 seconds

## Still Stuck?

### Last Resort Checklist:
- ‚úÖ Tried refresh button?
- ‚úÖ Used a recovery prompt?
- ‚úÖ Tried the Ask feature?
- ‚úÖ Refreshed your browser?

### The Nuclear Option:
```
Please rebuild the core app structure from scratch:
- Create a working React app
- Add routing for at least 3 pages
- Include a navigation header
- Use purple/white color scheme
- Make sure everything is clickable and works
```

## Pro Tips üí°

### Save Your Progress
- Copy successful prompts to a notepad
- Take screenshots of good designs
- Note what worked for next time

### Be Specific
Instead of: "Fix the error"
Try: "Fix the booking button that shows an error when clicked"

### One Thing at a Time
Fix one problem before moving on. Multiple fixes at once confuse Lovable.

### Use Examples
Show Lovable what you want:
```
Make the header look like Uber's - black bar with white logo on left and menu on right
```

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Panic Delete
Never delete everything to start over. Use rollback instead.

### Don't Stack Prompts
Wait for each prompt to finish before sending the next.

### Don't Assume It's Broken
Sometimes it just needs a refresh or a moment to load.
