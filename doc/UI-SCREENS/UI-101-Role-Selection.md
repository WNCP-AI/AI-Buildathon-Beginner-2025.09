# UI-101: Role Selection (DEPRECATED)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
**This screen is DEPRECATED in the actual implementation.** The actual SignUp.tsx component combines role selection with account creation on a single page using radio buttons, providing a more streamlined user experience.

**Actual Implementation**: Users select their role (Consumer/Operator) directly on the signup form via radio buttons, then complete registration in one step.

## Original Screen Purpose
Critical decision point where new users choose their account type, determining their entire experience on the platform.
