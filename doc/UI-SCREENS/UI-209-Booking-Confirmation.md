# UI-209: Booking Confirmation

## Screen Purpose
Toast notification confirmation displayed after a consumer successfully submits a booking request, providing immediate feedback within the service detail page context rather than navigating to a separate page.

## Actual Implementation Pattern
**Note**: The actual implementation uses a **toast notification** system rather than a separate confirmation page. This matches modern UX patterns where users remain on the service detail page after booking.
