- Use size, color, and spacing to guide attention
- Group related information together

### Consistency
- Use the same button styles throughout
- Maintain consistent spacing (8px grid)
- Stick to 2-3 fonts maximum
- Limited color palette (primary, secondary, neutral)

### Mobile-First
- Design for phones first, then scale up
- Touch targets minimum 44x44 pixels
- Readable text without zooming
- Single column layouts on mobile

### User Trust
- Professional photography/imagery
- Clear pricing information
- Visible ratings and reviews
- Security badges for payments
- Professional error messages

## Quick Design Checklist

- ✅ Is text readable on mobile?
- ✅ Do buttons look clickable?
- ✅ Is there enough white space?
- ✅ Are interactive elements obvious?
- ✅ Does it work on different screen sizes?
